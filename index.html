								<h3><a href="#articles1">Virtual Communities, A Platform for Bonding Social Capital</a></h3>
								<p>Virtual communities gather more and more people based on their interests regardless the distance. The promotion of interaction online helps the establishment of weak ties and even strong ties. This essay uses observation and interview as the main methods to explore the shaping process of bonding social capital in a fan “stand” on a popular social media “Weibo” in China, which is a small self-organized fan group. Based on the theories about weak ties from Granovetter and social capital from Putnam and supported by some related empirical studies, this essay claims that the dense interaction between fans online will push them to build small groups and the products from these small groups is a kind of bonding social capital.</p><br>
								<h4>Keywords: social capital, weak ties, virtual communities </h4>
								<br>
								<h3><a href="#articles2">Dynamic Cycle: Domestic Work and Its Workers</a></h3>
								<p>As the work holds less value compared to traditional wage labor, domestic work and subordinate people form a dynamic cycle of discrimination, where their inferior status is strengthened by their relationship and interaction. Being part of a dynamic cycle, domestic work and the status of being subordinate influence each other，changing the composition of the workers for different roles over time. When the importance of domestic work is realized through addressing their rights and giving protection in law, the injustices rooted in identities such as sex, race, and class are challenged. These injustices come from the match between domestic work and workers, from their defined inferiority. This essay will discuss, using the theories from MacKinnon, Crenshaw, and Glenn, that as domestic work is more valued, the society will respect the people who take this job, their status will be improved, challenging the injustices.</p>

								<h3>Virtual Communities</h3>
								<h3 class="major">A Platform for Bonding Social Capital</h3>
								<p>Along the continuous development of productivity and the increasing material and mental demands, popular culture and entertainment industries have become prosperous and influence ordinary people’s lives subconsciously, especially with the help of the Internet. Through this trend, there are many new phenomena in this area emerging and growing, especially empowered by the prevalence of Internet promoting the mutual flows of information and significantly raising the possibility of establishing the connection with others regardless of the limited interpersonal network and distance. And the transformation of fan culture is one example reflecting the universal change. In the traditional view of fan culture, fans tend to have individual activities like buying products such as albums, records, posts or tickets of concerts. If fans have some collective activities, it may be based on their existed connections. However, it has been changed to new forms of organizing and relationships online among fans, which indicates a kind of bonding social capital.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Putnam (1995) raises up an opinion that the social capital in the US has had a decreasing trend, and Oldenburg (1999) believes that modern media is an important reason for the decrease as it erodes “third places”, which is the public place for daily communal sociability. However, Putnam (2000) has a more positive view of modern media’s effect on the establishment of social capital. This essay tries to discuss the possibility of forming a relationship between social media and bonding social capital in the content of online fan culture.</p>
								<br>
								<p>In this paper, I argue that in the online fan culture, the connections within the self-organized groups in one virtual community are a kind of bonding social capital. The weak ties exist in the
									virtual community and bridge different and distant people, and its deeper development by dense interaction produces trust and cooperation, which are the features of social capital.
								</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Data and Method</h3>
								<p>The observed virtual community is a “community with the super topic” in a social media platform, Sina Weibo, and focuses on a small group “stand.” Weibo is the most popular social media in China, with 431 million monthly active users in Q2 of 2018 (Long, 2018). The function of Weibo is similar to Twitter: people post their comments, ideas, and photos on it; some social events can attract mass attention, and there are many celebrities that use the official accounts to communicate with their fans. Besides the functions that Twitter already has, Weibo has one special function called “community with the super topic,” which emphasizes the attribute of the community having some special interests. The main mission of “community with the super topic” is to promote people’s communication and relationships based on common interests. For example, people can choose to post in these communities, which can only be seen by people in these communities, and their followers cannot see it.</p>
								<br>
								<p>The communities with super topics related to celebrities are the main space for fans, where they discuss the idols and make friends with other fans. The chosen community with the super topic here is the Roy Wang community, with about 4.32 million followers, 8.29 million posts and it is read by 159.86 billion times. It is a very large and active community as well as young, due to the phenomenon that fans are mainly aged between 16 and 35, a generation that grown up accompanied by the quickly development of Internet and social media. The most impressive
									phenomenon in this community is that aside from the information about Roy Wang, there are many self-organized groups “stands,” which depart from their original and traditional function that producing photos and videos about idols, but turn to hold some charity programs, especially during some special times such as Roy’s birthday. The stands’ energetic participation in charity is one of the most evident characteristics of Roy Wang’s fan culture, that it also the reason why his community with super topic and his stands become my research objects.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>Observation and interview are the two main methods used. I set up a new Weibo account and spent five weeks interacting with other fans in this community by posting my comments about the idol, expressing my interest and affection for him, in order to observe the spread breadth of my information. I also tried to make friends with some fans by sending private messages to eight people, and six of them kept in touch with me and had some deep communication. One of them invited me to join a fan group “stand”, which aims to help some public welfare programs. In this organization, I made friends with other members and gained information about this specific “stand”. Eventually, I even had an opportunity to interview the leader of the organization.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Main Findings</h3>
								<p>In this part, two main theories I selected to support my argument that the virtual community can be an important platform to produce social capital by establishing small groups through built ties. Firstly, the Granovetter’s theory of weak ties is used here to prove that the dense interaction can promote the establishment of stronger ties based on the weak ties, and the weak ties widely exist in the virtual community, which supported by Steinfield’s (2008) finding. Additionally, it is
									argued that the connections within small groups they have organized are a kind of bonding social capital, according to Putnam’s theory of social capital with Steinfield’s extension and complementary.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>Firstly, I argue that people have opportunities and the tendency to build self-organized groups, based on the weak ties in the virtual communities. According to the definition of strength of ties from Granovetter (1973), “the strength of a tie is a (probably linear) combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding), and the reciprocal service which characterize the tie.” To be more concise, “closeness” or intensity is the best measure of tie strength (Marsden & Campbell, 1984). Strong ties represent closer relationships and the interaction is denser, providing wider range of support, even including financial support. Weak ties are also an indispensable part of people’s interpersonal network, aiming to carry new and unique information and resource among different small groups. Thus compared with strong ties, weak ties have important roles in the spread and diffusion of information. And this weak ties theory is applied to online social media by Steinfield. Through his empirical research, Steinfield (2008) claims that in social media like Facebook, the weak ties universally exist as the bridging social capital and serve to provide useful information and new perspectives. His claim can be validated by my observation that the weak ties in a virtual community can promote the spread of the information. One community with the super topic in Weibo can be seen as a place where its members have established wide weak ties. I posted the same things inside of and outside of the community with the super topic I studied three times, and the posts inside of the community were read over 1000
									times (1020, 1548, 2035) and had some comments while the posts outside of the community were read less than 100 times (87, 68, 43) without any comments. Besides，according to Granovetter’s (1973) definition, stronger ties means more input of time, emotion and other things. Having had such a wide network with weak ties and the convenience of connecting with others, people have the opportunities and possibilities to build stronger ties and enhance the friendship with different people by continuous communication regardless their geographic distance. If people cannot realize others’ existence, the establishment of strong ties will be impossible. It was the main channel I used to seek further communication with other members. People’s comments in my posts showed their interests in my posts, their opinions about my posts, and when I sent some private messages asking for deep communication with them, most of them responded actively. In such a virtual community, the weak ties give people a perfect precondition for developing relationship from loose to tight. And in the “stand” I interviewed, the strong ties were produced based on the weak ties as expected- “We had not known each other before we communicated with them in the community. We just forwarded Roy Wang’s posts and made some comments individually… We have become good friends, and even met with each other three months ago, though we are far away with each other and we are busy with our work.”
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Based on the stronger ties, the trust among people and need for belonging drives people to build small groups. Receiving information does not mean that the information can be trusted, because people only have trust in information if they have personal ties (Katz and Lazarsfeld 2017). The personal ties and trust needed for group formation are either existed before among some
									members themselves or established with the help of leaders and communication in virtual community among people who only have weak ties. Backstrom’s(2006) related research illustrates that in large online social networks, friends, which are existed strong ties between people, will play a “coordination effect” that people tend to have a stronger endorsement of a group or community when they have interconnected friends. Thus the formation of a group probably is built with the help of existed strong ties. Meanwhile, the members without existed stronger ties before is connected and their ties is enhanced by communication and leaders. The stronger ties people have through virtual communities contribute to the establishment of trust, considering that people prefer to trust people who are are more familiar with. The function of leaders should not be ignored. Granovetter (1973) claims that the trust for leaders comes from the intermediary personal contacts, which are linked to the ability to predict and affect their behavior. Members interpersonal trust naturally produces the center person, the “leader”, that members have stronger ties with the leader and trust him, and base on that member further build trust to the group and other members. It in turn promotes the emergence and stability of a small group. In the “stand” I interviewed, some of the members were recommended by their friends who are also members of this “stand”. Because members have stronger ties with their friends, the trust in these members and trust in this “stand” can be built very easily. And the head of the “stand” knows his members well and plays a coordinate role in activities organization. Besides, according to theory of triadic closure (Granovetter 1973), homophily (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001) people also have the tendency to organize a tighter group rather than a loose community because the stable strong ties
									can reduce people’s loneliness (Burker, Marlow, and Lento 2010). The interviewee said that she couldn’t do many things individually, and she realized that if she was in a “stand”, she would find a feeling of belonging, make some close friends and do something more and greater with collective struggles. Combining these two points, it can be concluded that people organize smaller groups based on the stronger ties and trust they already have or have built in the online social network, hoping to get more emotional and organizational power.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>Secondly, another argument is that the connections within the self-organized groups are bonding social capital, which can be proved through two dimensions of its external performances. Putnam (1995) has a definition for social capital- “features of social organization such as networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit.” He also claims that “civic virtue is most powerful when embedded in a dense network of reciprocal social relations” (Putnam 2000). Besides, Steinfield (2008) divides social capital into two different categories: bridging capital and bonding capital. The bridging capital “emphasizes the informational benefits of a heterogeneous network of weak ties,” and the bonding capital “emphasizes emotional benefits from strong ties to close friends and family.” According to the definition, the connections within the self-organized groups belong to the bonding capital, which links like-minded people with strong ties.</p>
								<br>
								<p>In order to test whether the self-organized groups “stands” belong to bonding social capital, the characteristics of their external performances are compared with Putnam’s standard definition. There are two parts of external performances of social capital: collective actions with cooperation
									and the social virtue embodied. The necessary aspects of collective actions are (1) common missions and motivation; and (2) incentives for collective actions. As for the common missions and motivations, Granovetter’s (1995) theory about weak ties explains that the frequent communication and close relationship in one group can help its members build up a broader sense of self- from “I” to “we”- and care more about the collective interests. On the one hand, people gather in small groups due to their common concerns and interests. On the other hand, the stronger and deeper relationship among members pushes their concrete opinions and ideas to converge. In this stand, the main mission is just like what my interviewee said: “Our mission is to express our love to Roy Wang, and all we do is to show that. That is the reason why we meet each other in this stand. Meanwhile what forms of activities we choose is the agreed decision made by everybody in this stand.”
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>The incentive is also required for collective actions. Olson (1965) argues that the dilemma of collective action can be better solved in small groups because the members in a small group can have a denser relationship with each other and the selective incentives can be achieved, considering the condition that the behavior of free-rider will be well noticed by other members of the small group. To build on the idea that online social networks can help people to form small groups, this kind of group has limited members with stronger ties and denser communication based on this specific virtual community, where the dilemma of collective actions can be solved better. For example, in the stand, members know each other, and when some members contribute a lot to the stand, they will be remembered and gain more respect and compliments from other members,
									which will encourage them to continuously contribute. With the common goal and incentives, coordination and cooperation inside the stand and collective actions for mutual benefit can be achieved easily. The phenomenon can be seen in this stand, where embodies a kind of “organic solidarity” that there is a clear division of labor and dependent relationship among its members(Durkheim 2014): “In our station, there are planners, money managers, and executors, and executors including artwork, writing work, Weibo account management etc.” It also has a completed cooperation mechanism: “If we want to do a project, one person will look for a good project, and then someone will contact and communicate with the leader of the project. After that, he/she will come back and inform members about the required amount of money, and then everybody in this stand will donate their certain amount of money to support this subject, of course, within everybody’s budget. And sometimes we also accept donation from people who are not the members of this stand… After that, the relevant responsible members will make the announcement, publish the copywriting and post them.”
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>Besides the emergence of collective actions and cooperation, the self-organized “stands” also show social virtues like social trust and kindness. Putnam (1995) points out that social trust and engagement is correlated. Here I divide social trust about the stand into two dimension-the trust existed among members in the groups and the trust existed between outsiders and the small groups. As the idea mentioned above, personal trust in the groups is the product of stronger ties and the precondition to establishing the self-organized small groups. And this kind of trust in group also promotes cooperation and engagement in the group. It can be seen in the practice of the stand I
									joined. Because the money that stands have is gathered by their members, members should have built trust, believing that other members will not appropriate this money for other personal reasons. Without trust, collecting money cannot be achieved. At the same time, the trust between outsiders and the small groups is established by the conveyed kindness and responsibility of the stands to society clearly through the public programs. There are different forms of social programs these “stands” adopt, such as organizing brand-new programs by themselves or donating money or other supplies to some established private or public social programs. Through their advertising activities on social media, the public recognize and praise their contribution to the society, which also attract more people with similar goals to participate in these “stands” or other similar groups. In this respect, these small groups also enhance social trust and activate social engagement. One month ago, the stand I interviewed did a program called “Water Cellar for Mothers”, and I got some details about this program from the interviewee:
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>“In order to celebrate Roy Wang’s 18th birthday this year, we did find a lot of public welfare projects. The reason why we chose this project is that the project of ‘Water Cellar for Mothers’ is 18 years old this year, as same as Roy Wang’s age. Of course, we also found that the ‘Water Cellar for Mothers’ has helped to solve the problems of drinking water in many areas of western China. We all know that the three most important things in life are sunlight, air, and water, so water is an indispensable thing for people. Thus we thought that this project is very meaningful. So we have chosen the project ‘Water Cellar for Mothers’, hoping that more people in these areas can drink safe and reliable water. We published our donating plan in the community with super topic, and
									we received some money from other fans besides our members’ personal donation. When we finished this program, we public the details about the spending.”
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>According to the definitions, discussions, and pieces of evidence above, the self-organized “stands” on Weibo are bonding social capital. Within the group, the personal trust is built, the characteristics of organic solidarity is embodied and the common mission is set, and out of the group, the social virtue and kindness are also showed and contributed to the society and the social trust to this kind of small groups is formed, which match the key features of the bonding social capital well. And with this support, the argument that online virtual communities can help produce bonding social capital by the self-organized groups is proved.</p>
								<br>
								<h3>Conclusion and Discussion</h3>
								<p>Firstly, through combining my own findings with the Granovetter’s theory about weak ties and Steinfield’s empirical research, it is proven that weak ties is prevalence in online social networks, and the nature of virtual community that people can communicate based on interests regardless distance and other external factors facilitates the development of strong ties and then people even form the smaller self-organized groups with stronger ties to seek for the feeling of belonging. Besides, the common commission and selective incentives push the collective cooperation in the stands, and the social trust in the stands facilitates activities and the social trust between public and the stands is built due to the social virtue the stands convey, which satisfies Putnam’s definition of bonding social capital. The discussion above clearly shows that
									development of stronger ties in virtual community is possible and the strong ties, to some extent, is a kind of bonding social capital.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>This phenomenon discussed here has appeared over a short time, and this kind of bonding social capital benefits a lot from the Internet and the establishment of virtual communities.
									Fan culture is a typical sample that this essay chooses to show that many traditional subjects undergo transformations in the period of the Internet. Sometimes the newly-formed subjects can bring some positive influence to the society, and it can be seen as the advantages of new technology. It can even be said that although nowadays the social capital in traditional forms are decreasing, the new kinds of social capital are still emerging and growing. Putnam’s claim about the decreasing social capital in American happened before the boom of Internet and virtual community. He argued that people had less time for social interaction and more time for other forms of self entertainment like television, thus cause the erosion of social capital and social engagement, it can not be reality at present, considering the realization of social interaction in the Internet. And Putnam also acknowledge his former claims limits when he take modern media into consideration. Therefore, we should keep a positive attitude to the development of technology and the changed lifestyle. Besides, there is also research needed to figure out that whether the social capital built based on virtual groups can be as stable and strong as the social capital based on organizations offline, considering that their ties are built on a virtual and much higher risk place while traditional ties are built more likely to be face to face.

								<h3>Dynamic Cycle</h3>
								<h3 class="major">Domestic Work and Its Workers</h3>
								<p>As the work holds less value compared to traditional wage labor, domestic work and subordinate people form a dynamic cycle of discrimination, where their inferior status is strengthened by their relationship and interaction. Being part of a dynamic cycle, domestic work and the status of being subordinate influence each other，changing the composition of the workers for different roles over time. When the importance of domestic work is realized through addressing their rights and giving protection in law, the injustices rooted in identities such as sex, race, and class are challenged. These injustices come from the match between domestic work and workers, from their defined inferiority. This essay will discuss, using the theories from MacKinnon, Crenshaw, and Glenn, that as domestic work is more valued, the society will respect the people who take this job, their status will be improved, challenging the injustices.</p>
								<br>
								<p>Domestic work is seen as the less valued work; thus, the less privileged people who take this work suffer greatly without enough protection. Only when their rights are addressed, their repressed situation and injustices can be challenged and solved. Domestic work, or social reproduction, is the work in households, which differs from production and biological reproduction. Wage labor, which involved in the process of production, is seen as the more valuable work because workers can exchange their labor power for the necessary physical materials in the form of money. However, at that time, social reproduction is positioned as subordinate. The work in homes is almost invisible and is ignored in Marxist’s perspective (Haider and Mohandest, 2015, p.7). Preparing meals, buying groceries, feeding and socializing children, cleaning clothes and furniture and so on (Glenn, 2015, p.71) is the main content of domestic workers. In a long time in the US, domestic workers were excluded from the basic labor protection of the law, which contributed to their suffering from abuse and harassment (National Domestic Workers Alliance, 2016). Given the fact that the majority of domestic worker are women of color and immigrants, the injustice domestic workers have faced comes from the gender, race and class injustices existing in the society.</p>
								<br>
								<p>From a macro perspective, the social structure of dominance gives different meanings to different works and people, which decides their status and values. This puts subordinate work and subordinate people into one cycle. The social structure can be seen as a structure of dominance, a theory of MacKinnon. According to MacKinnon’s argument, there is a hierarchical structure of dominance (MacKinnon, 1987, p.37), where men dominate the whole structure and women are the second class (MacKinnon, 1987, p.36), and the inequality is the result of power distribution between men and women (MacKinnon, 1987, p.40). In order to stabilize their statues, men emphasize the differences in gender and characteristics and then constructed women’s subordination by designed social order, standards and values. Under this structure, the male’s standard becomes the main standard and the measure of value (MacKinnon, 1987, p.34). This way, all women’s differences from men contribute to their inferiority, as they are less valuable according to male’s standard. With the common idea we have pointed out earlier that social reproduction is a less valuable work, society will naturalize the arrangement of labor division so that the less privileged people receive this kind of work. The inferiority of work and the inferiority of identities are thus reinforced mutually. Through addressing their rights and strengthening domestic workers’ power, the power distribution can be changed, these people can be saved from the injustices and subordination. </p>
								<br>
								<p>The division of labor between women and men can be explained through this structure of dominance. Society emphasizes the differences between men and women. It is commonly agreed that men are stronger, women are more tender, and women have the task of biological reproduction. Thus, women should pay their attention to the households and domestic work, while men should work outside and support the families by being a wage labor for production. When the division of labors with different values have been established and the unequal status of men and women have also been settled, the domestic work becomes the task of women naturally, as subordinate people should do the subordinate work. This social arrangement also conveys the opinion that women have advantages for social reproduction. With the help of this dynamic cycle, men’s dominance and privileged status and women’s subordination are established. It is obvious that all these inequalities come from the hierarchy of power in society, such that women are bonded with social reproduction without freedom, forming the cycle with their gender roles. If women can have more power and equal rights in this society, the sex injustice will be reduced, and even solved.  </p>
								<br>
								<p>The match between domestic work and its women workers has changed over time: the role of domestic workers changed throughout different historical periods in the US. And this change shows the combination of different factors and the process of naturalizing the phenomenon. Nowadays, according to the information given by the National Domestic Workers Alliance (2016), women of color and immigrant women are the majority of domestic workers in the US, but it has experienced three different periods in social reproduction labor based on the argument of Glenn(2001, p.73). In the period of 1850 to WWII, private reproduction labor was popular, when the burden of social reproduction in the middle class was heavy and white women moved the domestic work to the women of color without questioning the labor division between men and women (Glenn, 2001, p.74). In the next postwar period, along with the extension of capitalism, social reproduction labor became public. Women of color did the heavy and dirty jobs while white women were expected to do some professional and lighter work(Glenn, 2001, p.75). The coming globalization in the 1990s promoted the mobilization of labor worldwide, and more and more women came to more developed countries as immigrant domestic workers, in order to gain more money for supporting their families and feeding their children. In this established global care chain, immigrant women do the domestic work for western white women, and the immigrants’ children are cared by women in the home countries (Glenn, 2001, p.78-79). It should be noticed that beyond the assumption that domestic work should be finished by women, the work is further passed on to the different categories of women. Besides, in this process, society gradually naturalized the relationship between different people and their jobs, believing that this kind of inferior women was suitable for domestic workers in different periods (Glenn, 2001, p.75). And in this same process, race and class injustices affect workers’ situation in terms of their deserved rights are not achieved. </p>
								<br>
								<p>Among women, different identities have contributed to their situation. Therefore, we should analyze the injustices by including more factors in this cycle and considering the various identities together in an interlocking structure. The interlocking structure discussed here is built by Crenshaw’s theory of intersectionality. Crenshaw (2011, p.33) points out that in one group, the members’ experiences are different and there exists privileged members and less privileged members. And the privileged members can be the representatives and speak in the name of the whole group and use their experience and demands as the common experience and demands for all members while less privileged members’ demands will be ignored. It should be paid attention to that people have their own locations with different multidimensional identities (Crenshaw, 2011, p.40). It is known that women of color and immigrant women are the majority of the workers, and their gender, race and class identities are three aspects of their subordination. First, women are inferior compared with men; second, people of color are inferior compared with white people; third, working-class and immigrants people are inferior compared with middle-class and native people. As these identities determine their marginalization and powerlessness, they can’t be benefited from the law of anti-discrimination, can’t be better valued by the society, and can’t get enough protection from government and law. They are forgotten. Only when the rights of marginalized people with multidimensional identities can be addressed, the whole group of people can be freed from injustices.  </p>
								<br>
								<p>Except for the identities of gender and race, immigrant and working class are another two main identities that domestic workers have. The identity of immigrants is bonded with domestic work because, in the global care chain, immigrant women do the domestic work for rich families in more developed countries. Although domestic work is seen as the less valued work in a society and the wage of domestic workers is related low, the money immigrant women can get from this domestic work are far more than what they can get in their home countries (Glenn, 2001, p.78). Besides, people in the working class don’t have the advanced and unique knowledge or skills, so the work they do is less valued in common standard and their social status is also less privileged. The class injustice can be solved if we protect the rights of working class and immigrants.</p>
								<br>
								<p>These identities produce effect together in the interlocking structure and link women of color and immigrant women with domestic work in the US. They are pushed to accept being domestic worker, which link less privileged people and less privileged work. However, now the laws give some basic protections for domestic workers’ rights. In 2013, the law, the Domestic Worker Bill of Right, was signed in California, which has given legal protection and support for domestic workers: domestic workers have maximum hours, and they can get overtime pay for their work (Department of Industrial Relations, 2014). Addressing the rights of these workers shows the attempt to reduce domestic workers’ sufferings and improve their status. This law speaks out the demands of this kind of marginalized group in the society that reduces the inequality and injustices in different kind of works and reduce the gender, race and class injustices indirectly in this dynamic cycle. Through addressing their rights, , this cycle can transformed from a negative one to a positive one.</p>
								<br>
								<p>In conclusion, inferior work matches inferior people, and there is a dynamic cycle that these two inferiorities will reinforce the other one mutually. Sex, race and class inferiorities lead to their subordination, their limitation of job choices and social stereotype. Through paying attention to this less privileged group, giving basic protection to them in forms of law and addressing their rights, this cycle can be a positive cycle and their inferiority will be reduced, their voice will be heard and the sex, race and class injustices will be challenged. </p>
